# _Gummi Bear Kingdom_

#### _ a mock-up site for "Gummi Bear Kingdom", 12-4-16_

#### By _**Ian Wilcox**_

## Description

_this cite was built to fulfill the following requrements:
Database: Your database should be build code-first. We want to have simple setup on the Gummi Bear Kingdom servers, so you'll need to have a simple database migration set up, and ready to run.
Landing page: This is the main page, which includes some information about Gummi Bear Kingdom, and allows access to other areas of the site.
Products: The Products section should contain a list of products offered by Gummi Bear Kingdom. You should add a few "dummy" products, but don't need to add too many. The Products listed should each link to a Details page when clicked on. Products must have a name, cost and country of origin Within the details page, the admins want their product managers to be able to view, add, edit and remove products. You have some freedom to decide how that will work.
(Don't worry about authentication, for now assume that everyone who visits the site is an admin.)
Blog: Gummi Bear Kingdom want to become the go-to resource for gummi snack related discussions. The Blog section should allow contributors to post text posts discussing their chosen topic. The posts should have a title, author and text-body.
The blog posts should completely appear on the Blog page (no Details page needed), with the newest at the top._
